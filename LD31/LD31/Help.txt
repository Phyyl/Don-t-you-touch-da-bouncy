If the game doesn't launch, pleasemake sure the .Net Framework 4.5 is installed,
if you're not sure about this, there's an installer file in the Installers folder.

The game requires OpenAL too, so make to install that as well. The installer
file is also in the Installers folder.

If none of these solutions work, please send the .log files to : Phyyl@live.ca.
Make sure to included a brief description of your system's specifications and
operating system to help me debug better!

Don't forget to have fun :)
